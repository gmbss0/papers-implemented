# Implementation of papers
Interesting papers implemented...
In this repo I try to implement papers that I either find interesting or that are in an area outside of my current knowledge. Whenever I implement a paper I add a summary of the paper in the wiki and try to link useful resources that helped me during the implementation. <br> <br>
Here is a list of papers I implemented so far (or am currently working on):
* [VICReg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04906) (done)
* [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) (TBD)
*
